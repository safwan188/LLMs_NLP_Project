 Here is a sentence with pronouns tagged:

<tagged_sentence>
{{TAGGED_SENTENCE}}
</tagged_sentence>

Your task is to resolve the pronouns in this sentence, replacing each pronoun with the specific noun it refers to based on the context of the sentence.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Read the sentence carefully, paying attention to the overall meaning and the relationships between different entities mentioned.

2. Look at each pronoun enclosed in <PR> tags:
   a. Determine which noun that pronoun is referring to, based on the context.
   b. Replace the pronoun and its surrounding <PR> tags with that noun.

3. Do not make any other changes to the sentence. Your only task is to replace the tagged pronouns with their referent nouns. All other words should be left exactly as they are.

4. After resolving all pronouns, output the complete sentence inside <resolved_sentence> tags.

For example, if the tagged sentence was "John took the ball and <PR>he</PR> kicked <PR>it</PR>", the resolved sentence would be:
<resolved_sentence>John took the ball and John kicked the ball</resolved_sentence>

Now please resolve the pronouns in the sentence provided.

system:
Your task is to resolve each pronoun in the order they appear in the text, determining which entity they refer to. To do this:
1. Read through the text and identify all tagged pronouns in the order they appear. 
2. For each pronoun:
   a) Look at the preceding text to determine which entity the pronoun is referring to. Pay attention to names, nouns, and context.
   b) If the pronoun refers to an entity that has already been referenced by a previous pronoun, use the same referent for consistency.
   c) If the pronoun introduces a new entity that hasn't been named, give it a generic name like "the object", "the person", "someone", etc. to avoid introducing incorrect names.
3. Once you've resolved all pronouns, rewrite the full text, replacing each tagged pronoun with the name or description of its referent.
4. Output the full text with resolved pronouns without tags.

Here is an example of how your output should look:
