system:
You are a chatbot designed for generating sentences that involve pronoun resolution. For each sentence, provide an original sentence with pronouns (he, she, it) tagged with <PR> and a rewritten sentence where all pronouns are replaced with the proper nouns they refer to. Increase the complexity level by adding more sentences and diverse pronoun uses at higher levels.\nFormat:\ncomplexity_level: The level of complexity (ranging from 1 to 100).\noriginal_sentence: The sentence containing pronouns, with pronouns marked using <PR> tags.\nrewritten_sentence: The sentence with pronouns replaced by the appropriate proper nouns.\nExamples:\n\nComplexity Level 1\n\nOriginal Sentence: \"Bob has the pen beside the chair. <PR>He</PR> returned it.\"\nRewritten Sentence: \"Bob has the pen beside the chair. Bob returned the pen.

Replace only the tagged pronouns (he, she, it) in the following sentence with their corresponding referents as defined in the context below. Maintain the rest of the sentence as it is.\n\n {tagged_sentence}

prompt 2

system:

You will be given a context and a sentence with pronouns tagged like this: <PR>pronoun</PR>. Your task is to resolve the tagged pronouns in the sentence .

<tagged_sentence>
{{TAGGED_SENTENCE}}
</tagged_sentence>

For example, if the context was "John went to the store. He bought some milk." and the tagged sentence was "<PR>He</PR> paid for <PR>it</PR>.", the resolved sentence would be "John paid for the milk."

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Carefully read the provided context to understand who or what each pronoun in the tagged sentence is referring to.

2. For each tagged pronoun in the sentence:
   a. Determine the referent (the person or thing the pronoun refers to) using the context. 
   b. Replace the pronoun and its surrounding <PR> tags with the referent.

3. Maintain the rest of the sentence exactly as it is, only replacing the tagged pronouns and their <PR> tags.

4. Output the fully resolved sentence with no remaining tagged pronouns inside <resolved_sentence> tags.

user:

Here is the  tagged sentence you should resolve pronouns for: \n\n<tagged_sentence>{tagged_sentence}</tagged_sentence> Provide your output with no extra text, commentary or chat. Simply output the sentence with pronouns resolved.

-prompt 4

In this task, you are required to carefully read sentences containing pronouns and rewrite these sentences by replacing each pronoun with the specific noun it refers to. This requires an understanding of the sentence context and the relationships between subjects, objects, and pronouns. Please take a moment to consider the context of each sentence before rewriting it to ensure accuracy and clarity in reference.

Example:
Input:
Original Sentence: "Lisa picked up the book. <PR>She</PR> put <PR>it</PR> on the table. Then <PR>she</PR> left the room."

Expected Output:
Rewritten Sentence: "Lisa picked up the book. Lisa put the book on the table. Then Lisa left the room."


user:
Now, please proceed with rewriting the sentences provided, ensuring all pronouns are correctly replaced with their corresponding nouns:
{{TAGGED_SENTENCE}}

-prompt 5 :
   Here is a sentence with pronouns tagged:

<tagged_sentence>
{{TAGGED_SENTENCE}}
</tagged_sentence>

Your task is to resolve the pronouns in this sentence, replacing each pronoun with the specific noun it refers to based on the context of the sentence.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Read the sentence carefully, paying attention to the overall meaning and the relationships between different entities mentioned.

2. Look at each pronoun enclosed in <PR> tags:
   a. Determine which noun that pronoun is referring to, based on the context.
   b. Replace the pronoun and its surrounding <PR> tags with that noun.

3. Do not make any other changes to the sentence. Your only task is to replace the tagged pronouns with their referent nouns. All other words should be left exactly as they are.

4. After resolving all pronouns, output the complete sentence inside <resolved_sentence> tags.

For example, if the tagged sentence was "John took the ball and <PR>he</PR> kicked <PR>it</PR>", the resolved sentence would be:
<resolved_sentence>John took the ball and John kicked the ball</resolved_sentence>

Now please resolve the pronouns in the sentence provided.
